Planet Clojure
==============

This is the source code of [Planet Clojure](http://planet.clojure.in).

Planet Clojure runs on [Planet](http://planetplanet.org) which is
written in [Python](http://python.org/) (a *fine* programming language).

The template of Planet Clojure was designed by
[Brajeshwar](http://brajeshwar.com); so all credit goes to him.


Adding yourself to Planet Clojure
---------------------------------

If you have a blog on Clojure and want to feature on Planet Clojure,
fork this project on Github, edit the file `clojure/config.ini` and
add your blog feed URL and your name in the following format - 

    [http://path/to/your/blog/feed/]
    name = Your Name

After you are done, commit the change to your repository and send me a
pull request. I will be happy to add you to Planet Clojure.


Reporting Bugs

If you have an issue with the design or even Planet, feel free to send

my tree.
